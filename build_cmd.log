 ⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\daxx\package-lock.json as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.

> Build error occurred
Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./dax/components
Invalid import
'client-only' cannot be imported from a Server Component module. It should only be used from a Client Component.
The error was caused by using 'styled-jsx'. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.
